# Wordle Remake

This is a remake on the game Wordle built by Josh Wardle, a Welsh software engineer. 

## How to Play

![Instructions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timmywimmy95/Wordle-Game/main/Screenshot%202022-12-05%20at%2015-52-07%20Wordle%20-%20A%20daily%20word%20game.png)

Wordle gives players six chances to guess a randomly selected five-letter word. As shown above, if you have the right letter in the right spot, it shows up **green**. A correct letter in the wrong spot shows up **yellow**. A letter that isn't in the word in any spot shows up **gray**.
